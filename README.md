# What is Citizen?

All the solutions that are currently available are based on how we view the modern world and accounting. However with the game systems of Star Citizen being fundamentally different, it requires an entirely unique and new approach to managing funds. Payments are made sporadically and not on a measured and timed basis for some operations, while for others payments are orderly. The ability to calculate financial margins will also differ, as the profits won't include external factors such as currency since the world of Star Citizen has one set of flat currency that never depreciates. Itâ€™s not just a simple finance management system but rather an entire dynamic system that encompasses the financial sector, as well as the secruity and stablity of the organization as a whole. The project does not look at the problem as if it were an accounting issue but rather takes a holistic approach that considers the development, participation and depreciation or decline of the organization. Furthermore Citizen has to be based off of trust as the game does not allow external plugins so unlike current systems, failsafes will be needed in order to ensure that all the transactions have been completed and were legit and documented.



# What are the secruity risks at play and why do we need to combat them? 

As Star Citizen progresses it's development we will begin to see a large focus being placed on Organisations and the workings around it. This can be likened to games like Eve where the Oragnisation success is vital for all its members. 

With this large focus being implemented the other side of keeping an Organization profitable and successful is insuring that the members who attempt to join are considered " safe " and not possible insurgants or sleeper agents wiht alterrier motvies. These agents can pose a significant risk to an Organizations stablity as proven time and time again in Eve for example, these agents can relay important information regarding logistics and inventory to their Organisation which leaves your Org at a disadvantage and possibly risks you and your memebrs safety aswell as the safety of your assests. 

With this in mind Citizen aims to reduce this as much as possible by
